									<h3>Music</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<!-- My life is all about music.  -->
									My music journey started with <strong>digital keyboard</strong> when I was 5. 
									Afterwards, I learned the <strong>accordion</strong> and the <strong>violin</strong>.
									At college, I transitioned to the <strong>piano</strong> to keep advancing my keyboard skills and took a beginner <strong>Ruan</strong> class to get into Chinese instruments.
									I love classical music and film scores the most, and I hope to get into the field of music arrangement one day.

									<h3>Travel</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Travelling is always the most exciting thing throughout my holidays, no matter near or far.
									I love the <strong>nature</strong> so much and I think travelling is a good way to get into the nature - exploring the <strong>geography</strong>, the <strong>astronomy</strong>, the <strong>plants</strong>, the <strong>weather</strong>...
									<!-- I also enjoy taking photos of the beautiful scenerys and making fun vlogs for my trips (though not a pro).  -->
									I've travlled to most of the provinces in China but not many international trips.
									My next step is to travel around the US.
									<!-- I have been to 23 out of 34 provinces in China and several countries in Asia. -->
									<!-- It's a pity that I've never travelled around the US since I came here one year ago, but I've explored around Pittsburgh a lot. -->
									<!-- Hopefully I can keep on going on my trips soon after my busy school days. -->

									<h3>Dance</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I was once a <strong>ballet</strong> learner throughout my childhood but have been away from it after finishing junior high school. 
									So I'm now a huge ballet fan but not a dancer any more:( 
									The good news is I'm easing back to it recently and hope to take some in person classes after covid.
									My dream is to perform some classical variations on pointe again on the stage in the future.

								<header><h3>Plants</h3></header>
								<p>
									I enjoy growing plants because they can brighten up my home and cheer me up! 
									At my home in China, I grew <strong>vegetables</strong> and <strong>fruits</strong> on the balcony to enjoy fresh foods.
									During my undergraduate, I grew different kinds of <strong>flowers</strong> in my dorm.
									Now in the US, however, all my attempts to grow plants from seeds failed:( So I'm now finding my ways to <strong>fresh cut flowers</strong>.

								<header><h3>Pets</h3></header>
								<p>
									I love pets, but I haven't got any in my life so far:(
									For the question <strong>cats</strong> or <strong>dogs</strong>, I love them equally, but it seems I've become more of a cat person than a dog person after following lots of cat vloggers.
									Due to many limitations, I can only <strong>"cloud raise"</strong> a cat on the Internet. (Thanks tech!)
									I hope that I can adopt a cat when I settle down to work after graduation.

								<header><h3>Cook</h3></header>
								<p>
									Everyone loves food, but not anyone can cook. 
									I'm also a newbie in cooking, but I'm working hard to advance my cooking skills.
									I like Asian food the most, such as <strong>Chinese food</strong> (Cantonese food is the best!) and <strong>sushi</strong>.
									I also enjoy watching <strong>baking</strong> tutorials to see how the delicated pieces are made, but always failed when doing on my own:(
