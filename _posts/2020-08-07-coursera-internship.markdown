# **Overview**
I worked as a software engineer intern at Content Platform - Core Content team, focusing on frontend web development. Our team takes the ownership of the content authoring platform , which is heavily used by instructors authoring thousands of courses consisting of different item types on Coursera. As a frontend engineer, I worked closely with the product manager and designer to figure out the design of the features, as well as with backend engineers on designing the API interfaces.

It was so rewarding to see that my efforts were seen and used by instructors to provide learning resources to learners worldwide, and I learned so much during this internship. I also got to know more about web accessibility and internationalization, which I'm quite interested in, and hope to get deeper into. 

# **Project 1 - Coursera Markup Language (aka CML) Rich Text Editor**
My first project was about improving the user experience on CML rich text editor. There existed some inconsistency in the design of the file uploader and in the renderer of the rich text editor. This project consisted of two parts: the first part was to update the user flow of asset uploading modal to the new design, and the second part was to update the image rendering method of "image asset" type. 

# **Project 2 - Video Uploading Progress**
My second project was about improving the user experience on video uploading. Since all lecture videos should be transcoded to different resolutions, it takes a while for a newly uploaded video to finish transcoding before publishing to users. In this project, I created a progress indicator component for displaying the transcoding progress to users by periodically polling from the backend API.
