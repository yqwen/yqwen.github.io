# **Overview**
I worked as a software engineer intern at Content Platform - Core Content team, focusing on frontend web development.
As a frontend developer, I worked closely with the product manager and designer to figure out the design of the features. I also worked with backend developers on designing the API interfaces.
It was a holistic experience for me to build new features from end to end.

# **Project 1 - Coursera Markup Language (aka CML) Rich Text Editor**
My first project was about improving the user experience on CML rich text editor. There existed some inconsistency in the design of the file uploader, and the rich text renderer for images. This project consisted of two parts: the first part was to update the user flow of asset uploading modal to the new design, and the second part was to update the image rendering method of "image asset" type. 

# **Project 2 - Video Uploading**
My second project was about improving the user experience on video uploading. Since all lecture videos should be transcoded to different resolutions, it takes a while for a newly uploaded video to finish transcoding before publishing to users. In this project, I created a progress indicator component for displaying the transcoding progress to users in real time using polling.

# **Tech Stack**
