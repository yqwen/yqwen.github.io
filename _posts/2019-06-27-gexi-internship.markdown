# **Overview**
Gexi is a startup company that aims at providing a K12 English learning platform for primary schools. During my internship at Gexi, I mainly worked as a frontend engineer on the internal platform on the Web Operations Management System (which is used by the Operations Department to manage user information). I worked with the product manager to figure out potential improvements on the current system, talked to colleagues from the Operations Department, and deicded on which features to implement. Then, I developed features such as customized sorting, batch uploading/downloading with Excel, etc., which greatly improved the working efficiency of the Operations Department. I also took an initiative on implementing hybrid HTML5 pages for a newly lauched campaign in the mobile application, and worked with mobile developers to investiage different methods to achieve interactions between H5 and native app. 

It was my first internship as a software engineer, and it was a holistic experience for me to build new features from end to end. I also started to learn more about frontend developing and became more interested in it. I really enjoyed building new UI components that are reusable and interactive.
